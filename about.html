        <p>I'm a master's aerospace engineering student at Georgia Tech and research assistant at the Space Systems Design Lab working on satellite optical navigation systems.</p>
        <p>Before my master's, I completed my undergrad at Georgia Tech. During that time, I was a research assistant at both the Aerospace Systems Design Lab and Low-Gravity Science and Technology Lab working on model based systems engineering techniques and launch vehicle fuel sloshing, respectively.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academic life, I enjoy engaging in reading, working on cars, and doing film photography.</p>
