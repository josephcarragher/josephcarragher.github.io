        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a masters aerospace engineering student at Georgia Tech and a researcher at the Space Systems Design Lab working on satellite guidance and navigation systems.</p>
        <p>With that said, this website mostly contains extra-curricular musings. That tends to include tidbits or results from miscellaneous projects I work on and hobbies of mine.</p>
