        <p>I'm currently a research engineer within the Air and Missile Defense Division of the GTRI Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Lab. I've received my BSc and MSc in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech, during which I was a research assistant with the SSDL. My research focuses on the intersection of state estimation and remote sensing.</p>
        <p>On a less academic note, I've been focusing a lot on self-improvement in my free time--mostly being physically active still and continuing to study Korean. I also periodically dabble in film photography and work on my car.</p>
