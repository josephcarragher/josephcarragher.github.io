        <p>I'm in the final semester of my master's degree now. The prospect of leaving the world of university is equally exciting and worrying--starting that chapter of my life is enticing, but the prospect of disconnecting from academia and learning is a frightening one. I hope I continue to learn and grow in a stimulating environment.</p>
        <p>To work on personal growth, I've been focusing on myself outside of my career as well. I've started reading regularly for the first time since about middle school--presently I'm working through some of Asimov's novels; I enjoy his writing style a lot. Also, I've been studying Hangul and learning more Korean lately. It's a fun language to practice and it's been rewarding getting to use it with friends and at restaurants near where I live. Eventually, I'd like to be properly conversational in the language.</p>
