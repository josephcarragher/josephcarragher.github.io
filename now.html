        <p>I'm currently in the final semester of my master's degree, so wrapping up my research projects and looking forward to industry work or further education has filled my plate lately.</p>
        <p>For whatever reason, I decided it would be a good idea to join a club in my final semester. Genuinely, it has been very enjoyable and fun work--it's been a great experience doing interesting work in optical navigation.</p>
        <p>I'm looking forward to being done with school. As much as I've enjoyed it, and want to stay in touch with academia and research, starting a new chapter of my life is enticing.</p>
