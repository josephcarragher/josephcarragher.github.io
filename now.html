        <p>I'm a researcher now! This past February I joined the GTRI Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Lab to develop algorithms for tracking and navigating spacecraft, primarily with radar. Going to a UARC or similar was my top choice post master's so I'm incredibly happy to be here.</p>
        <p>This period has been one of great transition for me--but the journey I'm on is everything I've wanted for so long. The freedom associated with having a career has allowed me to start rediscovering myself after devoting my time and energy to school for the past 6 years. I'm starting to really feel like a new person. At the same time, I still get to engage in academia via post-master's and professional education courses--an opportunity I've already and plan to continue taking advantage of.</p>
